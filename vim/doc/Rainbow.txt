INSTALL
	vim rainbow.vba.gz
	:so %
	:q

TUTORIAL					*:rainbow-tutorial*
	Simply edit one of the supported filetypes
	(currently, c, c++, matlab, Latex, or javascript):

	    vim somefile
	    :Rainbow   -- this will turn rainbow highlighting on
	    :Rainbow!  -- this will turn rainbow highlighting off

MANUAL							*:Rainbow*

					*rainbow-c* *rainbow-cpp*
	:Rainbow and C/C++:~
	This command will enable rainbow highlighting for C and C++.
	One may also pass the desired set of delimiters to be
	rainbow'd via this command: (also see |g:hlrainbow_c|) >

		:Rainbow {[(
		:Rainbow {(
		:Rainbow {[
		:Rainbow [(
		:Rainbow {
		:Rainbow [
		:Rainbow (
<
	These forms of the :Rainbow command alter the g:hlrainbow
	variable value.

							 *rainbow-lisp*
	:Rainbow and Lisp:~
	For lisp, :Rainbow (and, conversely, :Rainbow!) enable/disable
	rainbow highlighting for Lisp (*.lsp) files.

							 *rainbow-matlab*
	:Rainbow and Matlab:~
	For matlab files, :Rainbow and :Rainbow! provide/disable rainbow
	highlighting for Mat (*.m) files.  One may also pass a selective
	set of items to be rainbow'd via this command:
	(also see |g:hlrainbow_matlab|) >

		:Rainbow if for switch while
<
	or any subset.

							*rainbow-tex*
	:Rainbow and TeX:~
	This command enables rainbow highlighting for LaTeX (*.tex) files.
	It isn't intended for regular use, but to make it easier to locate
	problems with missing "$"s, etc.

							*:Rainbow!*
	:Rainbow!~
	This command will disable rainbow highlighting for C and C++.

	This plugin provides a "rainbow" of colors for matching brackets
	( [] () {} ) depending upon their nesting level; it is intended to
	provide support the C and C++ languages.

					*g:hlrainbow_c* *g:hlrainbow_cpp*
	g:hlrainbow_c/g:hlrainbow_cpp:~
	This global variable holds characters such as "(){}[]"; by default
	it holds "{(".  It enables rainbow highlighting as follows:
	  "(" or ")":  ( and ) rainbow highlighting
	  "{" or "}":  { and } rainbow highlighting
	  "[" or "]":  [ and ] rainbow highlighting

							*g:hlrainbow_js*
	g:hlrainbow_js:~
	This global variable holds characters such as "(){}"; by default
	it holds "{(".  It enables rainbow highlighting as follows:
	  "(" or ")":  ( and ) rainbow highlighting
	  "{" or "}":  { and } rainbow highlighting

						*g:hlrainbow_matlab*
	g:hlrainbow and Matlab:~
	This global variable holds a string which may contain one or more of
	the following words: >

		if for switch while
<
	and enables rainbow highlighting for the associated Matlab grammar.

3. History						*rainbow-history* {{{1

 v2	Oct 20, 2009	* supports Rainbow command to turn rainbow
			  highlighting on/off.
			* (Greg Klein) pointed out that "contained" seemed to
			  be missing from the cParenXX definitions.
			* I've commented out the cCppParen definitions,
			  letting cParenXX work.  I noticed a problem with
			  these: (the following closing parenthesis got
			  highlighted as an error)
			    int f(int x,
			          int y)
			  and I'm afraid I don't remember why there was
			  a separate set of definitions for C++.  If anyone
			  sees a problem -- please give me an example (short
			  is good)
	Nov 01, 2009	* :Rainbow {[( and variants supported.
	Sep 26, 2011	* Matlab, LaTeX, and Javascript supported
	Oct 19, 2012	* Included rainbow-parentheses support for Lisp
